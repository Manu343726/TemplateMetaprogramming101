Modern C++ Metaprogramming scripts
==================================

Scripts, examples, and utitilities for my workshops about template metaprogramming with modern C++.

## Setup

This repository contains several scripts designed to setup an Ubuntu x64 Virtual Machine, like those provided under the TravisCI environment. Just clone this repo and run `install.sh` and that machine will be ready. You can create an account on [koding.com](https://koding.com/), a colaborative programming service which provides an online Ubunto virtual machine for free. Thats the setup I will be using during the workshops, to ensure everybody is working with exactly the same setup.

*`install.sh` currently under development, I don't give any guarantee about its behaviour.*

## License

The scripts, examples, and utilities provided by this project are released under a simplified version of the BSD license, see the `LICENSE` file for more information.
